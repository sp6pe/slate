# Introduction

Coinbase provides a simple, fast, and reliable REST API for Ethereum developers. We know it's hard to build on Ethereum, and that's why we've built enhanced endpoints that make key tasks trivial 

This API reference provides information on available endpoints and how to interact with them.

# Authentication

To use the Coinbase Enhanced API, you need an API key to authenticate your requests. To obtain your API key contact us [here](https://developers.coinbase.com/).

The Coinbase Enhanced API expects for the API key to be included in the Authorization header or in the URL parameters like: `api_key=API_KEY`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>API_KEY</code> with your personal API key.
